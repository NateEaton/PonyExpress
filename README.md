# The Pony Express Archive

A digital archive of North Mesquite High School's student newspaper from the 1974–1975 school year.

**Live Site:** https://nateeaton.github.io/PonyExpress/

## Origin

I'm Nathan Eaton, and I served as school photographer during my senior year at North Mesquite High School. I kept all the issues of *The Pony Express* that I worked on, and they spent decades stored away in my attic. After retiring and attending our 50th class reunion in 2024, I decided it was time to share these with my classmates.

## Purpose

The goal of this archive is to provide a **free, easily accessible** place for classmates to access a piece of their high school experience. This stands in contrast to how high school yearbooks and newspapers are typically made available: behind paywalls; these are your memories and you shouldn't have to pay to revisit them.

## Technical Details

### Scanning Process

If you have additional issues to contribute, here's the process and specifications used for this archive:

**Tools:**
- A modern scanner (I used a Canon TR8500 series multifunction printer/scanner)
- Scanning software capable of multi-page PDFs (I used [VueScan](https://www.hamrick.com/))
- Software with OCR capability to embed searchable text in the PDF

**Scan Settings:**
- **Size:** 8.5" × 11"
- **Resolution:** 150 DPI
- **Color Mode:** Grayscale
- **Format:** PDF with embedded OCR text
- **Cover Format:** PNG image
- 
### File Naming Convention

Files are named using the publication date in `YYYY-MM-DD.pdf` format:
- Example: `1974-09-11.pdf` (September 11, 1974)

Cover images follow the same convention: `YYYY-MM-DD.png`
